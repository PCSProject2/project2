  <h5> Welcome and thank you for stopping by to look over
my wares.  I have been doing fancy-work on-and-off for
over fifty-five years, ever since I was initially taught it by an
old sailor who lived quite close to me.  I used the know-
ledge through my Navy days and have now taken it up again
as a full-time business. I am also a part of the International Guild of Knot Tyers.</h5>

  <div id="Information">
    <h5> I make belts, lanyards, wheel-coverings, tiller-wraps, hand-rail wraps, bellropes
of varying complexity, instrument straps, camera straps,  luggage slings....
if you can do it with a piece of  line, I've probably either made it or seen it. </h5>
  </div>
  <div id ="Belt">
    <h5> Belts are "made-to-length" (although I do keep some standard-length
belts on hand) and vary from simple squareknots throughout, to
ten-diamond designs,   open and filled diamonds, chevrons and crosses,
etc., etc.  Prices run from $120.00  for a small plain belt up through the
roof for specialty items. I also can make suspenders (galluses). </h5>
